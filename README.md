## Overview
* The main purpose for Just Share, Don't Buy is to allow downtown residents the ability to share items with their neighbors that are rarely used and difficult to store. These items could include a step ladder, carpet cleaner, tennis racquet, or event space such as a backyard patio and/or conference room. 

* Our motivation came from living in small apartments in San Francisco, CA that have very little closet space. Most people would not want to take up the little space they do have to store an item that only gets used once per month. If our neighbors have the item we are looking for, there should be a place to post the item and have it available to share with neighbors close by. Just Share, Don't Buy is the answer to this problem.
